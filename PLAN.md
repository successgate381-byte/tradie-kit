# UteDocs plan

How we work: copy-paste blocks only (heredoc formula), typecheck + lint + test after every change,
nothing existing is dropped (the lock lists guard that), batches of two or three blocks.
Tick a line only when it is built, tested and you said "clean".

## Done
- [x] Lite rebuilt from scratch (Blocks 1 to 5): nine tabs, client name / signature / date typed ABOVE the line,
      Australian look, A4 print, browser tests, feature lock. Backed up on branch utedocs-rebuild.

## Decisions (confirmed 10 Oct 2026)
1. Remote accept link: built last in Pro (P8), switched on after Cloudflare is live. The Privacy page must say what is stored.
2. Progress claim: a new tab with contract total, % complete this claim, earlier claims, GST and balance remaining.
   Plain "check your state rules" note. No legal claims.
3. Job photos: a gallery per job, with tick-boxes to print chosen photos on an extra PDF page.
4. Starter packs: more job suggestions plus ready-made scope, inclusions and exclusions wording. No prices.
5. Xero CSV: built to Xero's own template. The real import test is done by you later (needs a free Xero account).
- Pro costs $47. Lite price $27 is proposed, not confirmed. Pro shares Lite's code, so a Lite fix reaches Pro.
- Cloudflare, domain, public pages and Gumroad come AFTER Pro.

## Pro build ($47)
- [x] P1 Pro shell: /pro/ page runs the same app plus a Pro badge; extension points in Lite (hooks). Done when: every Lite test passes inside Pro.
- [x] P2 Client signature pad (Quote and Variation): finger or Apple Pencil, Clear and Undo, small image shown above the line on Preview and PDF, accepted date added. Done when: drawing test passes, page does not scroll while drawing.
- [x] P3 Progress claim tab (decision 2). Done when: maths tests pass.
- [ ] P4 Xero invoice CSV export (decision 5). Done when: columns match Xero's template.
- [ ] P5 Job photos (decision 3): take or pick, resize, store on the device, optional PDF page. Done when: resize and storage tests pass.
- [ ] P6 Starter packs, Electrician and Plumber (decision 4). Done when: packs load and can be edited.
- [ ] P7 Licence gate: server checks the Gumroad key, signed cookie, "Remember this device" ticked by default, Forget button. Done when: good key opens Pro and wrong key does not (pretend Gumroad here, real one later).
- [ ] P8 Remote accept link (optional): send link, client signs, you check status, 60-day expiry. Done when: tested with a pretend store.

## After Pro (not started)
- [ ] Cloudflare Pages: connect the repo, build folder site, add utedocs.site, hello@ forwarding, make the repo private, switch GitHub Pages off, merge to main.
- [ ] Public pages: landing (Lite and Pro), Terms, Privacy, Refund, Support.
- [ ] Gumroad: Lite and Pro products, licence keys, receipt messages, test purchases.
- [ ] Launch checks: real phones (Android, iPhone, iPad), legal read-through, support routine.
- [ ] QuickBooks only after a real Australian account test.
